Alderson & Doyle - Robust yet fragile

### Anesthesiology case study

* resident taks to surgical fellow, gets word that it's a short procedure, surgeon expects little blood loss
* attending recognizes details of patient's other conditions, and tells resident to show up early and put in extra lines
* extra lines establish access to put in fluids or meds as needed, should crisis arrive

Attending is anticipating problems ahead.
