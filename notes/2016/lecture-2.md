* finite resources
* continuous change


florescence: rapid increase (flowering)


How does an org perform at managing complexity?


Positive stories: different adaptive units are responding to changes seeking opportunities.


* value graceful extensibility
* sustained adaptability
* capacity for maneuver

negative stories:
* brittleness & decompensation
* shortfalls & mis-calibration
* trapped in trade-offs

- driver of extended & hidden interdependencies
- cases of repeated florescence
