## Slides


### Surprise at boundaries

**Competence envelope**

plans, procedures
automation, contengencies

borderlands

"here be dragons"


### Surprise at boundaries

Competence (base) envelope

trade-off

P/R ratio near boundary
graceful extensibility

borderlands
what Dragons lruking?

Cascades,  friciton, changing tempos

### Graceful extensibility

borderlands

what adaptations produce graceful extensibility?

(desriptive) brittleness

what dragons lurking near, at and beyond boundary?

anticipating crunches ahead

genearting/sustaining a readiness to respond


## Notes

pressures â†’ conflict

can't meet expectations


* open landscape
* dancing landscaep

think in processes and relationships, not nouns

adaptive capacity:
* base (far from the boundaries)
* extended (near the boundaries)

these trade off each other


good architecture to sustain adaptability:
* makes it easy to improve one type of adaptive apacity without degrading teh other one too much


### Readiness to respond

#### Deployable

Example: anaesthesiologist case
* plans for worst-case surprise by adding emergency lines

#### Mobilizable

Example: crisis training.
* preparing people so they could mobilize as teams
* know how to help each other and do things in order to handle a crisis
