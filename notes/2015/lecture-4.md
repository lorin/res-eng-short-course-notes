# Maladaptive patterns and critical incidents in urban firefighting
* If requset resources when need is definitive, it is alraedy too late
* Regulate additional adaptive capacity (tactical reserves)
  - maintain **capacity for maneuver** (ability to handle next surprise)
  - "avoid all hands situation" (incident command)
* Bumpy transfers of control

# Decompensation
* Actions of one group increase threats to other groups (opposing fire hoses; rendering escape routes or protected areas unaccessible)
* Failure to resynchronize
* Goal priorities/conflicts in response to distressed firefighter
* Tradeoff between information sharing versus data bottlenecks

# Working at cross-purposes (both horizontal and vertical)
* Failures to modify plans in progress as situation and kinds of threats change

# Getting stuck in outdated behaviors


# 10 proto-theorems

From [The theory of graceful extensibility: basic rules that govern adaptive systems]

1. Boundaries are universal
2. Surprise occurs, continuously
3. Risk of saturation is monitored and regulated
4. Synchronization across multiple units of adaptive behavior in a network is necessary
5. Risk of saturation can be shared
6. Pressure changes what is sacrificed when
7. Pressure for optimality undermines graceful extensibility
8. All adaptive units are local
9. Perspective contrast overcomes bounds
10. Reflective systems continually risk mis-calibration
