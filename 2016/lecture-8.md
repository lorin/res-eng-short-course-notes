### Modeling UABs

Network of adaptive units / UABs

finite resources / continuous change → have adaptive capacity over a range

surprise is normal and ongoing → brittleness as range is exhausted

risk of saturation / exhausting capacity for maneuver 

what provides graceful extensibility

risk of decompensation - can't keep pace with change

continuous able to re-ask / answer what is fitness?

adaptive value - what adaptations change fitness?


multi-role, multi-echelon

unit of interest - neighborhood

do neighbors constrict or extend CfM of unit at risk?

risk of locally adaptive/globally maladaptive behavior

cases: tragedies of the commons, unraveling of matching markets, patient boarding in the ER

what synchronizes the network?
