adaptive landscape

boundaries are dynamic


If you want to change beahvior, change the goal conflicts

pressure → conflicts → adaptation

pressure leads to conflicts which lead to adaptation

the way things change change

what matters is not what assumptions you made. It's: can you change your assumptions?

tradeoffs

boundaries are dynamic

dancing landscape

Resources:
* deployable (expensive)
* mobilizable


Resources need:
* anticipation
* synchronization
* reciprocity
* initiative

We have to get better in the short run due to pressure to increase efficiency.


Events inevitably challenge boundary conditions → brittelness

fundamental tradeoffs:
* optimality-britteleness (Doyle)
* acute-chronic, FBC pressure (Woods)
* efficiency-thoroughness (Hollnagel)
* bounds on perspective (Woods)

Given finite resources, uncertainty, and change:

algorithms/plans/models (competence envelope) vs. complexity/variability/surprise (graceful extensibility)


No matter what it is, it's not that you do it well, it's that you can hange how you do it.


Drawing tradeoffs in graphs:
* two dimensions


What you score is what counts.

When there's pressure on your role, to let other people know something isn't working puts you at risk, which means you're not going to synchronize across roles very well. 


ONe of our goals is for you to start seeing how unintended consequences arise if you think linearly about change.

Problems:
* thinking too linearly
* thinking of each unit as more passive than they really are
* mis-modeling how the world looks from those other perspectives

Brain has an architecture:
* high net adaptive value
* good at getting better at responding to frequently experienced situations
* remains highly sensitive to novelty
* quickly learn what's typical, quickly try to get better at processing what's typical
* stays sensitive to what's atypical
* invokes mechanisms to figure out what's a good way to deal with the atypical situation

learning is really relearning

brain is good at having more than one typicality. e.g.: how students behave differently:
* at campus during class
* on Friday night on capus
* at Thanksgiving at home
