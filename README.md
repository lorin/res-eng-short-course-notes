# Notes on David Woods's Resilience Engineering short course

These are my personal, unofficial notes on [David
Woods's](https://complexity.osu.edu/people/woods.2) Resilience Engineering
short couse.

Official course site: <http://csel.org.ohio-state.edu/ResilienceEngineering.html>

The lectures are available for free online at the link above.

## Direct links to lectures

The videos on the official page are in iframes, which seems to prevented Chrome
from viewing them in full screen mode. Here are direct links to the videos,
which allows the videos to be full screen.

I watched the videos at 2X speed using the Chrome [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk) plugin.

### Papers

*Woods mentions several readings in his lectures, but as of this writing there
isn't a publicly available list of them. I've tried to guess based on his description of them in the lectures*.
