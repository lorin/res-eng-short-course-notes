# Notes on David Woods's Resilience Engineering short course

These are my personal, unofficial notes on [David
Woods's](https://complexity.osu.edu/people/woods.2) Resilience Engineering
short couse.

Note: these notes are based on older lectures. There are now newer lectures available

## Newer lectures

The newer videos are hosted on YouTube at <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvlZBj1NU_ikTy1ot30EbEbYMAoBf9eAt>.

I haven't seen these yet, so I don't know how much has changed from the oldre lectures.

## Older lectures

There used to be an official course site at: <http://csel.org.ohio-state.edu/ResilienceEngineering.html>

However, it now returns a 404. The direct livestream links still appear to be available:

I watched the videos at 2X speed using the Chrome [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk) plugin.

* [Summary](summary.md)

### Handwritten notes

* [As a single PDF](notes.pdf)
* [As multiple SVGs](handwritten-notes)

### Typed notes

* [Lecture 1](lecture-1.md)
* [Lecture 2](lecture-2.md)
* [Lecture 3](lecture-3.md)
* [Lecture 4](lecture-4.md)
* [Lecture 5](lecture-5.md)
* Lecture 6 (no typed notes)
* Lecture 7 (no typed notes)
* Lecture 8 is missing
* Lecture 9 (no typed notes)
* Lecture 10 (no typed notes)
* [Lecture 11](lecture-11.md)
* [Lecture 12](lecture-12.md)

## Readings

### Books

[Flash boys: A Wall Street Revolt by Michael Lewis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24724602-flash-boys)

### Papers

*Woods mentions several readings in his lectures, but as of this writing there
isn't a publicly available list of them. I've tried to guess based on his description of them in the lectures*.
